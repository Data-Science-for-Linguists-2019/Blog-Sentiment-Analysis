Progress report #1

2/21/19

I began investigating the dataset using Pandas. In my Jupyter notebook file [` progress_report1.ipnyb` ](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/progress_report1.ipynb), I created a DataFrame for the blogs and compiled some basic statistics: the number of blogs per author, gender, industry, and astrological sign. I also created data visualizations for each stat. After looking at basic stats, I did some preliminary exploration into the blog texts by looking at token frequencies and average blog length.

__Data sharing plan:__

The Blog Authorship Corpus's license states that it may be freely used for noncommercial purposes. From this, it seems that it would be okay for me to reupload the data onto Github. However, since there are 681,284 blog posts, that is maybe too much data for me to share with my classmates for this project. I created a smaller subset of the data, with 100 randomly selected blog posts.

The subset is titled [`mini_data.csv`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/data_samples/mini_data.csv), and can be found in the [`data_samples`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/master/data_samples) folder of my project repo.
